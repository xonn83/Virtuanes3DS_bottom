## VirtuaNES for 3DS

VirtuaNES for 3DS is a high compatibility NES emulator for your old 3DS or 2DS. It's not as accurate as FCEUX or Nestopia, but it runs at full 60 FPS for almost all games, and supports tonnes of mappers: MMC1,3,5,6; VRC1,2,3,4,6,7; and tonnes of other mappers. As a result, the library of games it supports are huge. 

This 3DS version also fixes a few bugs from VirtuaNES's MMC5 mappers and even plays Rockman 4 Minus Infinity and Zelda Legend of Link hacks.

It also runs on your New 3DS as well!

## .CHX Cheat File format

The .CHX is a cheat file format that you can create with any text editor. Each line in the file corresponds to one cheat, and is of the following format:

     [Y/N],[CheatCode],[Name]

1. [Y/N] represents whether the cheat is enabled. Whenever you enable/disable it in the emulator, the .CHX cheat file will be modified to save your changes.
2. [CheatCode] must be an NES Game Genie 6- or 8-character cheat code. An NES Game-Genie code looks like this: **GXOUSUSE**.
3. [Name] is a short name that represents this cheat. Since this will appear in the emulator, keep it short (< 30 characters). 

The .CHX must have the same name as your ROM. This is an example of a .CHX file:

Filename: **8x8 Eyes.CHX**
```
Y,GXOUSUSE,Most attacks won't damage Orin
Y,GXNGNOSE,Most attacks won't damage Cutrus
```

NOTE: If you enable a cheat, and then disable it, you may need to reset the game for the disabling to take effect.
